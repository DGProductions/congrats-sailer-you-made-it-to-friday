- All finalised artworks should go to "EXPORT" folder.

- If there are 5+ artworks made and published inside the folder a "Vol.#" folder can be created (not mandatory) to reflect the volume compilation.

- After the published volume compilation has been uploaded as a video, the corresponding "Vol.#" folder can have a pre-fix "(Uploaded)"

- In case a single artwork has been created and uploaded with a song (SoundCloud or other), then a prefix "(Published_w_Song)" should be added and file should remain in "EXPORT" folder. If the same song w/ artwork gets uploaded in a compilation, the artwork should be moved to the corresponding compilation folder & prefix should be removed.
